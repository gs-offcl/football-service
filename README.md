## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 11](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases?version=11)
- [Maven 3.x](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
